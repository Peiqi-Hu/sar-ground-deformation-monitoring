## Large img file take too long to processing unwrap
After analyzing the workflow, realized the bottleneck was processing the full img file. The solution was to return to the very beginning, select a subset/ROI of interest, and then perform unwrapping which dramatically reducing processing time while keeping results focused on the target area. See `tutorials\preprocess-sar.md` for the process regarding how to make subsets.
